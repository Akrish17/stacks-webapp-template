## Getting started

As a general rule the steps to get one of our npm environments up and running are
* for local execution
  1. Clone the project and navigate to the relavent path.
  2. run the following commands in the following order
  ```bash
  $ npm install
  $ npm run build
  $ npm run build:watch
  $ npm npm run start
  ```

There is already a prebuilt version of the template-cli up on npm, if you don't wish to build this locally you only need to execute steps 3, 4, 5 and 6

readme location: `packages/template-cli/README.md` 

A browser window should open up and automatically havigate you to the correct place but if not go to 1 of the following URLs

```
http://localhost:3000
http://localhost:3000
```

You should now see an empty react site and have some code to play around with, enjoy yourself :).
